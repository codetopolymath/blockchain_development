way to generate keys is illustrated in public_vs_private_key.py file, please find instuction there.
SYMMETRIC VS ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY:
    [*] symmetric cryptography uses same key in between sender and receiver. key is used to encrypt and decrypt message.
    [*] assymetric cryptography used two types of keys, public and private. linked with special mathematical relation. 
        eg:
            message ---> encrypted with public key ---> decrypt only with private key
            message ---> encrypted with private key ---> decrypt only with public key
        so with assymetric cryptography people can communication secreatly without exchanging key first.

so in generally in cryptocurrency world, 
    generating private key is account creation.
    address or username is derived from public key which is being gererated from private key.
